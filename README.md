# Capstone-project# Energy Consumption Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing energy consumption using data-driven techniques. It leverages machine learning and data analytics to analyze consumption patterns, identify inefficiencies, and recommend solutions to reduce energy usage effectively.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Processes energy consumption data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Machine Learning:** Implements predictive models to forecast energy demand.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Suggests strategies to minimize energy wastage.
- **Visualization:** Provides interactive charts and graphs for better understanding.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/energy-consumption-optimization.git
   cd energy-consumption-optimization
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Open the `energy_consumption.ipynb` notebook.
- Load your dataset and run the cells step by step.
- Analyze the results and optimize your energy usage accordingly.

## Dataset
The project uses a household energy consumption dataset, which contains the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of recording.
- **Time**: The time of recording.
- **Global_active_power**: The total active power consumed (in kilowatts).
- **Global_reactive_power**: The reactive power consumed (in kilowatts).
- **Voltage**: The supply voltage (in volts).
- **Global_intensity**: The total current intensity (in amperes).
- **Sub_metering_1**: Energy consumed by kitchen appliances.
- **Sub_metering_2**: Energy consumed by laundry appliances.
- **Sub_metering_3**: Energy consumed by electric water-heaters and air conditioners.

Ensure your dataset follows this structure for accurate analysis.
